# PID_Cascade_Control_Sliding_nodes
PID controller implemented in a cauldron with a valve using a cascade method with feed forward. The lineal fifth grade transfer function are described in the paper "Simulation Study of A Main Stream Temperature System Based on Predictive Functional-PID Cascade Control" written by ZHOU Lei, FEI Shumin and HUANG Jiacai affiliates with the School of Automation, Southeast University and the Nanjing Institute of Technology. In the same way, we used configurations of PID to compare the results with other controllers like the follower in state space and the sliding modes method, also we implemented another techniques useful to improve the control process like the smith's predictor and the anti-windup method. We considered the results as a satisfactory behavior thanks to the realized job, achieving an over-impulse and stabilization time similar to the expected.
